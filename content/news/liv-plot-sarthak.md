We can create a highly informative and visually appealing Last Interaction Velocity plot using Matplotlib.

If you're using the Last Interaction Velocity plot for exploration, consider creating an interactive version with Plotly. This allows you to zoom, pan, and inspect data values by hovering, resizing the scale, and more conveniently.
