TARDIS-Con 2024 has come and gone. After another unique two-week un-conference, we are exhausted but very proud of the many projects that we worked on.

On the TARDIS side, we worked on improving the code's efficiency, implementing new features, and discussing the latest scientific insights related to supernovae.

Our insights into Science of Science grew rapidly. We looked at how international collaborations become more prevalent in the last decades. 

We also enjoyed some group outings, including a day trip to Ann Arbor for a local craft market and a detour through an escape room.
